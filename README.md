### **💭 My thoughts on this project:**  
This is my **fourteenth project**, and for a beginning, I'm proud of it! 🎉  
- It took me **11 days** to build this entirely.

It was a great learning experience, especially for **my problem-solving skills**, my comprehension of **Librosa, Clustering and Sound Analysis** on that exercise.

💡 My strengths: Determination, self-taught mindset, problem-solving and curiosity.

🚀 Areas for improvement: Code syntax.
